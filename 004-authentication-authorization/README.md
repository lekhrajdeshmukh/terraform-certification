## Default Configuration for authentication

- If shared files lines are not added to provider block, by default, Terraform will localte these files at $HOME/.aws/config and $HOME/.aws/credentials on Linux and macOS.

- For Windows it would be "%USERPROFILE%\.aws\config" and "%USERPROFILE%\.aws\credentials"
